## Process Overview <a name="process"></a>

This section describes the steps for submitting the results to Red Hat Partner.
If you do not plan to share the results with Red Hat, you can skip this section.

Overview of the process for applying the results to the Red Hat Partner support case:

0. Install an OpenShift cluster on **the version desired** to be validated
1. Prepare the OpenShift cluster to run the validated environment
2. Download and install the OPCT
3. Run the OPCT
4. Monitor tests
5. Gather results
6. Share the results archive with Red Hat Partner support case

It's not uncommon for specific tests to fail occasionally. As a result, you may be asked
by support engineers to repeat the process a few times, depending on the results.

Finally, you may be asked to upgrade the cluster to the next minor release.

More details on each step can be found in the sections below.

## Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

A Red Hat OpenShift 4 cluster must be
[installed](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/installing/index.html)
before validation can begin. The OpenShift cluster must be installed
on your infrastructure as if it were a production environment.
Ensure that each feature of your infrastructure that you plan to
support with OpenShift is configured in the cluster (e.g. Load Balancers, Storage, special hardware).

OpenShift supports the following topologies:

- Highly available OpenShift Container Platform cluster (**HA**): Three control plane nodes with any number of compute nodes.
- A three-node OpenShift Container Platform cluster (**Compact**): A compact cluster that has three control plane nodes that are also compute nodes.
- A single-node OpenShift Container Platform cluster (**SNO**): A node that is both a control plane and compute.

OPCT is tested in the following topologies. Any topology flagged as TBD is not currently supported by the tool in the validation process:

| OCP Topology/ARCH | OPCT Initial version | OPCT Execution mode                        |
| --                | --                   | --                                        |
| HA/amd64          | v0.1                 | regular(v0.1+), upgrade(v0.3+), disconnect(v0.4+) |
| HA/arm64          | v0.5                 | all                                       |

!!! info "Unsupported Topologies"
    You can run the tool in unsupported topologies if the required configuration
    is set. However, the report provided by the tool may not be calibrated
    or have the expected results for a formal validation process when applying
    to Red Hat OpenShift programs for Partners.

OpenShift Platform Type supported by OPCT on Red Hat OpenShift validation program:

| Platform Type | OCP Supported versions |
| --            | --                     |
| External      | v0.5+                  |

!!! info "Unsupported Platform Type"
    You can run the tool in other platform types if the required configuration is set.
    However, the reports may not be calibrated to produce the expected results,
    leading to failures in platform-specific e2e tests requiring special configuration
    or credentials.

The matrix below describes the OpenShift and OPCT versions supported:

| OPCT [version](releases) | OCP tested versions | OPCT Execution mode                |
| --                       | --                  | --                                |
| v0.5.x                   | 4.14-4.18           | regular, upgrade, disconnected     |
| v0.4.x                   | 4.10-4.13           | regular, upgrade, disconnected     |
| v0.3.x                   | 4.9-4.12            | regular, upgrade                   |
| v0.2.x                   | 4.9-4.11            | regular                            |
| v0.1.x                   | 4.9-4.11            | regular                            |

It is highly recommended to use the latest OPCT version.

### Standard Environment <a name="standard-env"></a>

A dedicated compute node should be used to avoid disruption of the
test scheduler. Otherwise, concurrent workloads, e2e-test manager
(openshift-tests-plugin), and other cluster components (e.g., monitoring)
could disrupt the test environment, leading to unexpected
results (such as eviction of plugins or aggregator server pods).

The **minimum** test environment can match the table below.
Note the differences of minimum RAM for the `Dedicated Test` node
is different than regular compute nodes:

| Machine/Role   | Count | CPU | RAM (GB) | Storage (GB) |
| -------------- | ----- | --- | -------- | ------------ |
| Bootstrap      | 1     | 4   | 16       | 100          |
| Control Plane  | 3     | 4   | 16       | 100          |
| Compute        | 3     | 4   | 16       | 100          |
| Dedicated Test | 1     | 4   | 8        | 100          |

*Note: These requirements are higher than the [minimum installation requirements](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.html#installation-minimum-resource-requirements_installing-bare-metal) because of the resource demands of the conformance environment.*

#### Environment Setup: Dedicated Node <a name="standard-env-setup-node"></a>

The `Dedicated Node` is a regular worker with additional labels and taints to run the OPCT environment:

1. Choose one node with at least 8GiB of RAM and 4 CPU.
2. Label the node with `node-role.kubernetes.io/tests=""`.
3. Taint the node with `node-role.kubernetes.io/tests="":NoSchedule`.

Example:

```sh
oc label node <node_name> node-role.kubernetes.io/tests=""
oc adm taint node <node_name> node-role.kubernetes.io/tests="":NoSchedule
```

Starting on v0.5+ you can use a command to find the best node and apply the required taint:

```sh
opct adm setup-node
```

#### Setup MachineConfigPool for upgrade tests <a name="standard-env-setup-mcp"></a>

**Note**: A custom `MachineConfigPool` is required only when the OPCT is run in `upgrade` mode. If you are not running upgrade tests, skip this section.

Create a `MachineConfigPool` named `opct` that selects the dedicated node and remains `paused` so that the node won't be rebooted during cluster upgrades:

```bash
cat << EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: MachineConfigPool
metadata:
  name: opct
spec:
  machineConfigSelector:
    matchExpressions:
    - key: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role
      operator: In
      values: [worker,opct]
  nodeSelector:
    matchLabels:
      node-role.kubernetes.io/tests: ""
  paused: true
EOF
```

Verify the `MachineConfigPool`:

```bash
oc get machineconfigpool opct
```

#### Testing in a Disconnected Environment <a name="disconnected-env-setup"></a>

OPCT uses several container images during the setup and execution of tests.
See [User Installation Guide - Disconnected Installations][installation-disconnected.md] for details on configuring a mirror registry and directing OPCT to pull images from that mirror.

### Privilege Requirements <a name="priv-requirements"></a>

A user with [cluster admin privileges](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/using-rbac.html#creating-cluster-admin_using-rbac) is required to run the tool. You can also use the default `kubeadmin` user.

## Install <a name="install"></a>

You can download the OPCT binary from [the Project Releases page](https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/opct/releases).
Choose the architecture matching the node on which you plan to run the tool:

```sh
BINARY=opct-linux-amd64
wget -O opct --max-redirect=2 "https://github.com/redhat-openshift-ecosystem/opct/releases/download/latest/${BINARY}"
chmod u+x ./opct
```

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### Run conformance tests <a name="usage-run"></a>

**Requirements:**
- A dedicated node
- OPCT installed locally

#### Run the default execution mode <a name="usage-run-regular"></a>

```sh
./opct run
```

To watch execution progress:

```sh
./opct run --watch
```

#### Run the `upgrade` mode <a name="usage-run-upgrade"></a>

`upgrade` mode upgrades the cluster to a specified 4.Y+1 release, then runs conformance suites to validate the upgraded cluster:

```sh
./opct run --mode=upgrade --upgrade-to-image=$(oc adm release info 4.Y+1.Z -o jsonpath={.image})
```

**Note**: Before running upgrade mode, you must have created the `MachineConfigPool` named `opct` and installed the `oc` client.

#### Run with Disconnected Mirror registry<a name="usage-run-disconnected"></a>

If you have a disconnected mirror registry configured, run:

```sh
./opct run --image-repository ${TARGET_REPO}
```

### Check status <a name="usage-check"></a>

```sh
./opct status

# Or watch until completion:
./opct status -w
```

### Collect the results <a name="usage-retrieve"></a>

```sh
./opct retrieve
```

Optionally specify a directory:

```sh
./opct retrieve ./destination-dir/
```

### Check the results archive <a name="usage-results"></a>

```sh
./opct results <retrieved-archive>.tar.gz
```

#### Review the report <a name="usage-report"></a>

```sh
./opct report <retrieved-archive>.tar.gz
```

### Submit the results archive <a name="submit-results"></a>

How to submit OPCT results from the validated environment:

- Log in to the [Red Hat Connect Portal](https://connect.redhat.com/login).
- Go to [`Support > My support tickets > Create Case`](https://connect.redhat.com/support/technology-partner/#/case/new).
- In the `Request Category` step, select `Product Certification`.
- In the `Product Selection` step, for the Product field, select `OpenShift Container Platform` and select the version you are using.
- Click `Next` to continue.
- In the `Request Details` step, `Request Summary` field, specify `[VCSP] OPCT Test Results <provider name>` and provide any additional details in the `Please add description` box.
- Click `Next` to continue.
- Click `Submit` when you have completed all the required information.
- A Product Certification ticket will be created. Please follow the instructions provided to add the test results and any other related material for review.
- Go to [`Support > My support tickets`](https://connect.redhat.com/support/technology-partner/#/case/list) to find the case and review status or to add comments.

Required files to attach to a new support case:

- Attach the detailed Deployment Document describing how the cluster is
  installed, including architecture, flavors, and additional/specific
  configurations from your validated Cloud Provider.
- Download, review and attach the [`user-installation-checklist.md`][installation-checklist] to the case.
- Attach the `<retrieved-archive>.tar.gz` result file to the case.


### Environment Cleanup <a name="usage-destroy"></a>

When validation is complete, destroy the conformance environment:

```sh
./opct destroy
```

You must manually remove the OpenShift cluster afterward.
